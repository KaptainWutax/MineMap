This tool has been moved to https://github.com/hube12/Minemap since I wanted to get out of the fork since KaptainWutax didn't had the time to maintain his.

To download it head to the [Releases section](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/releases/latest).

This is a program to replace the old amidst with a non Minecraft based one (meaning you can run it without Minecraft
installed), it is also way more efficient since it is fully multithreaded.

There are severals nice features added, you can see per layers of biome generation, find closest structures, draw
circle, area and use a ruler.

Supports all Minecraft release starting from 1.0+

## Support and bugs

- This project is still in its enfancy (while packing most of the necessary features) so bug will likely still happen
  inside it.

- However, as it is actively maintained you can get a hold of me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mn47bWvFjf) or by
  simply submitting a bug report in the [Issues](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/issues) tab.

- We also have a roadmap of future ideas [here](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/projects/1) and you are welcome to
  open a discussion [here](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xa6cpSjsqZ)
  to ask for any feature that you deem reasonable enough (be aware for performance issues some might be denied).

## Development

You just need to have the Java JDK installed then do:
`git clone https://github.com/hube12/MineMap`

Go in the directory and run `./gradlew run` to run Minemap (we enable the no-update option)

Run `./gradlew shadowJar` to generate the release jar (modify Minemap.version and gradle.properties MinemapVersion
variables accordingly)

To use vulkan with debug and validation layers please install the vulkan Lunar SDK.
